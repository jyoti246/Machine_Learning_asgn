All the three parts are done in seperate files named mlass2a.py , mlass2b.py and mlass2c.py respectively.
First copy the data from data folder and keep it in the same folder as the codes.
Then to run each code write "python3 <name.py>" in terminal and run.

The desired output of part B is:
Our Logistic Regression model mean Accuracy=  0.8642901813633522 Precision=  0.0 Recall=  0.0 and Scikit model Accuracy=  0.866166353971232 Precision=  0.6051587301587301 Recall=  0.11554689508653704

The desired output of part C is:
Our Decision tree model mean Accuracy=  0.5747342088805504 Precision=  0.5520075435801218 Recall=  0.47297493491759507 and Scikit model Accuracy=  0.5497185741088181 Precision=  0.4989338752355548 Recall=  0.4781005832683793
